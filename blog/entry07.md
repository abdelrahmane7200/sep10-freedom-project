# Entry 7
##### 6/6/24

During the final phase of my Freedom Project journey, I had the opportunity to present my Chemistry website at both the SEP Expo and in our classroom. This experience helped me develop my presentation skills and gather valuable feedback from visitors and peers.

### Expo Elevator Pitch Takeaways
The Expo was going to be not a full presentation with slides as we practiced in class (mentioned later on). It was actually going to be a 1 - 2 minute quick 'presentation', and so, I needed to create something that would show all the importantance of my project, while still being short.
This is why it is called the elevator pitch, as it's supposed to fit in an elevator ride.
I learned:
* How to pitch an idea in a short time
* How to figure out what is important about something so big, and how to explain that in short yet effective sentences.

### In-Class Presentation Reflections
Presenting to my classmates provided a good learning moment and experience:
* Got to present in front of many people, which prepared me for my SEP Expo
* Got feedback from peers and teacher
    * I should talk a bit slower
    * Try to 'show' more of my presentation (I didn't really 'point' much, or put my audience's focus on the specific thing(s) I was refering to)
* It was fun, and very helpful overall :)

### Development Journey
Throughout this project, I've grown significantly in:
1. Technical Skills
   * React development
   * Component-based architecture
   * State management
   * Responsive design
2. Soft Skills
   * Public speaking
   * Project management
   * Problem-solving
   * Time management

### Next Steps
As I conclude this project, I plan to:
1. Incorporate feedback received during presentations
2. Prepare for showcase if I get picked. If not, (3)
3. Enjoy releasing all the stress of the project :>
