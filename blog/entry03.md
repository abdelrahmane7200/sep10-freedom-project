### Overview 
For my overview, I introduced my topic (Chemistry), along with why technology is essential for the topic. However, after I got my feedback from my teacher, I learned that I was using too much first person words. Possibly from writing blog-entries like this and writeups on what I'm learning, but, I was using things such as "..what I'll be..", etc.

### Part A | Present Examples 

I had already researched hardware and softwares used in chemistry, however, I didn't have any pictures that could go along with them, which was one of the requirements. I searched for images that were interesting and went along with my researched tech, and added them. Problem was that I added the URL to the website that contains the image, not the image itself, so I had to open the image in a new tab and copy it's .png/.jpg URL (which is basically a URL to **just** the image). Thankfully, most of my websites from my research on the technology contained images, so I didn't have to look very far for them. A website that helped me for a lot of things is [britannica](https://www.britannica.com/), which contains a lot of the information that I got. 

### Part B | Future Idea
My idea was Something like an infrared thermometer that can figure out the exact compound of the thing being measured.  
  For this part, I splitted it into 3 main sections. The first section which is how I decided to plan it, this is basically just:
* The name
* It's primary function (What it'd use to do what)
* Expanded technology (What technological things could it contain)

The second section was how it'd work, which is the longest, and most time-consuming research I've eveer done, or at least from the ones I can remember currently. This section mentions:
* Components
* How the components work together
* Application (This includes who would use it, what it could be used for, and how it can be helpful.)  
  While this section has the same amount of things included in it as the first and last section, it was still probably 3x bigger in size, and 20x harder to research. Because, not so surprisingly, but it's **hard** to research for something that doesn't exist. Things similar to this exists, but even mastering their knowledge isn't enough to the understanding of my idea.

The third section was Challenges and Considerations, which is probably the easiest part of part B, because it was just thinking about what could go wrong, and in life, so many things can go work that it's impossible to not find any. This section wasn't really planned out like the other ones, I kind of just rolled with what I could think of. 

### Overview 
This planning was the easiest and hardest in my opinion, I could simply copy what I researched before, and add on my idea of a technology that could exist in the field of chemistry in the future. it was probably the most creative part of the project so far, and creativity is fun; it's like freedom, you get to just.. think, and type out your ideas and imagination.
