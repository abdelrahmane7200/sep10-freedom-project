# Entry 4 | Picking tools
##### 2/24/25

## Getting introduced to tools
Outside of basic HTML, CSS, and eventually bootstrap, we were asked to learn an extra tool on our own to use on this project. It's a part of the skills that are very important, LOYO, Learn On Your Own.
This was actually very interesting, you wouldn't think that learning something is fun, but when you get to choose it, it kind of is. A way I can explain the feeling is building your own PC, seeing all the videos online of cool computer stuff makes you invested, picking the parts makes you excited, and building it is the skill that you actually have fun doing and learning. Similarily to this, when I see very cool websites and web applications, that's the 'seeing videos online part' that makes me invested, looking at all th tools is the 'picking the parts' section, where **I** get to choose what **I** learn based on what **I** want to create, and this level of 'customization' is actually very fun, and I don't want to take it for granted.
## Tinkering
We had a list of tools of which we could pick from, ranging from simple styling things, all the way to tools that actual, popular applications use. But outside of them being htere looking pretty, we obviously had to check out the ones we found interesting, as it wouldn't be so fun to pick a tool then later on realize that tool is absolutely useless. For me, I did do a bit of javaScript, and I do find it a lot of fun, so I picked react as my main option. For those who don't know, react is basically javaScript but with HTML inside of it, which makes implementing elements way easier and makes the code more compact. For my backup option I put A-Frame, as it's something that's special and can't really be created, at least easily, in normal HTML, CSS, and Js.
## Picking the tool
Picking the tool was kind of stressful at first when thinking about, because you had to be locked into one choice and couldn't go back. But the same with picking a topic for the project, it wasn't that hard because despite there being tons of otols, there could onjly really be a handful that you'd be interested in, and even then, there's definitely 3 or less that you find better than the rest. At the end of the day, after you really try them out, you can easily figure out which one you want to do, which is what happened with my choice. I found only two that were really interesting; AFrame and reactJs, and after only I'd say 30 minutes of testing them out I noticed that I enjoyed using react way more than AFrame, which nailed it down easily.
## Overview
Overall, picking tools was very fun, even more fun than picking topics in my opinion. I got to enjoy learning about more things while also knowing that I'd get to use them properly, and maybe this is just me, but when I have a task I have to do that I get to do with something I like, it just makes the experience 10 times better. I think I'm going to really enjoy playing around with jsx, hopefully just not too much that it'd distract me.
