# Entry 1 | Deciding on my topic

## Choosing a topic  
The topic I decided to pick for this project was religion. This is due to the fact that I find religion very interesting and important, I'll talk about more reasons to why I picked this after my backup topics.
#### I have 2 backup plans, and those are:
* _Chemistry_
* _Communication_  
### My reasons for both of these goes as follows:
* **Chemistry**  
I've found things such as [colored fire](https://www.thoughtco.com/top-chemistry-projects-604170) very cool, and I've always wanted to learn what makes fire a certain color, and how people can adjust the color
And even just the fun facts are very interesting, like, for example, did you know that [glass is a liquid?](https://www.superprof.com/blog/incredible-science-facts-chemistry/) Yep, that's right, glass is a liquid, _and_ it's flowing! It's just flowing at a very small speed, one that would take millions of years to move as much as water does in a moment. The technology used to test these stuff is so perfectly made, that it's even hard to think that humans made this, which just makes chemistry even more interesting.
* **Communication**  
Communication is one of those topics that can be talked about for forever. While communication doesn't seem that interesting, [it's history](https://education.cfr.org/learn/timeline/two-hundred-years-global-communications), and how it improved over the centuries is such an expansive topic. It can go to so many different routes of knowledge, that you can't ever really know everything about it. Humans used to write letters, ones that would take over a month to reach to who they wanted it to reach, and then double the time to get a message back. But now, you can open your phone and send a message to someone on the complete other side of the world, and they'd get it in less than 0.1 seconds from the moment you get it. And, most humans don't even know the simplest way for how these instant worldwide communication work.
### My reasoning for my main topic:
 I think religion's significance on society is massive, and basically everyone follows, or at least knows one. So why wouldn't I create a website on such an important topic that I'm passionate about? Yea, there's no reason I shouldn't. For why I'm intersted in the topic of religion; it's becaue once I started being a more curious person, I've always wanted to find the answers to the questions science can't answer. Ones such as "Why do we exist?" or "What's our purpose?" And, I'm not really here to convince you to follow a specific religion, or even any religion. My website won't be to persuade people to do anything, but it'll be to inform them about such a cultural significance. While technology is pretty hard to fit in this topic due to the fact that there are barely any religions or belief systems that are popular from even 10 decades ago, you'll still be surprised by things that are used in this. Things such as [**carbon-dating**](https://news.uchicago.edu/explainer/what-is-carbon-14-dating#:~:text=Radiocarbon%20dating%2C%20or%20carbon%2D14,of%20the%20carbon%2D14%20isotope.) for manuscripts, and websites that give you resources to learn about a religion are all technological things that relate to religion. 
### Some skills I learned while searching for a topic:  
* How to research topics when it comes to anything
* How to write about something in an informal yet interesting way
* How to skim through blogs & articles
