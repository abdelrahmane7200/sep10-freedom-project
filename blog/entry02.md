# Entry 2 | Software & Hardware

## Context  
I've decided on a [topic](https://github.com/abdelrahmane7200/sep10-freedom-project/edit/main/blog/entry01.md) to create my website on a few weeks ago. And recently I've been researching technologies in that topic (Chemistry). I've researched both software (Apps, websites, etc) and hardware (Physical technologies, ex; computer). I've searched and picked the ones I found most interesting, while still being very useful and important in the chemical field.
