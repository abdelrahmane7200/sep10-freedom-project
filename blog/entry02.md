# Entry 2 | Software & Hardware

## Context  
I've decided on a [topic](entery01.md) to create my website on a few weeks ago. And recently I've been researching technologies in that topic (Chemistry). I've researched both software (Apps, websites, etc) and hardware (Physical technologies, ex; computer). I've searched and picked the ones I found most interesting, while still being very useful and important in the chemical field.
### Software  
I picked 5 different softwares that related to chemistry, here's a list of them, and my reasoning behind it.  
1. [ChemDraw](https://revvitysignals.com/products/research/chemdraw)  
ChemDraw is an app that is used for drawing chemical structures. It's very useful as it turns the chemical drawings into IUPAC nomenclature, which is a method of naming chemical structures according to the [IUPAC](https://iupac.org/). Since the app supports [reaction mechanic annotations](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-chemistry-beta/x2eef969c74e0d802:kinetics/x2eef969c74e0d802:reaction-mechanisms/a/reaction-mechanisms) (The sequence of steps that makes a chemical reaction occur), it's helpful in the understanding of chemical reactions. And for the last bit of information I found about the app, is that it connects with other chemical databases, making it easy for referencing to them.
2. [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/)  
It is a 3D molecule building app. Unlike other apps that are similar, this one allows for real time molecular editing and supports [quantim mechanical calculations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/quantum-mechanical-calculations#:~:text=Quantum%20mechanical%20calculations%20refer%20to,the%20principles%20of%20quantum%20mechanics.). Since this app is open source, this means it is even customizable with plugins, making it do things no other app could, which makes it super dynamic.
3. [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/gaussian16/)  
This app is made for computation chemistry modeling, but it can do so much more than that. Gaussian can preform [DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) (desnity functional theory) calculations. This makes the app helpful for chemistry, but also for physics as well, but that's not my topic so I didn't dig into it that much. This app makes data that's very useful accessible (continue from vibrational.. in notes)
