# Entry 7
##### 6/6/24

During the final phase of my Freedom Project journey, I had the opportunity to present my Chemistry Technology website at both the SEP Expo and in our classroom. This experience helped me develop my presentation skills and gather valuable feedback from visitors and peers.

### Expo Elevator Pitch Takeaways
The Expo something
* Something
* Something

### In-Class Presentation Reflections
Presenting to my classmates provided a good learning moment and experience:
* Got to present in front of many people, which prepared me for my SEP Expo
* Got feedback from peers and teacher
    * I should talk a bit slower
    * Try to 'show' more of my presentation (I didn't really 'point' much, or put my audience's focus on the specific thing)
* It was fun, and very helpful overall :)

### Development Journey
Throughout this project, I've grown significantly in:
1. Technical Skills
   * React development
   * Component-based architecture
   * State management
   * Responsive design
2. Soft Skills
   * Public speaking
   * Project management
   * Problem-solving
   * Time management
