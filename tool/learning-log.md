# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: ReactJs

## Context
I started tinkering with this tool a while ago but now is when I've started going deep into it and knowing actual, semi-advanced stuff in it. Currently the main thing I'm doing is creating things and deleting it, and crating new things and deleting it, over and over again. I'm using a combination of my HTML and javaScript knowledge to create tiny apps or pages, which is what I did, and do, to learn javaScript. It forces me to think about ways of doing things, and forces me to think about new things I want to do.
## How I'm teaching myself
As I mentioned, I create things over and over, but let me get detailed. I attempt things that I know I can learn do, but also won't be too hard that it'd take me over 3 days to do. Every time I think of an idea, I immediately attempt it, because that way I can fail as quickly as possible. Now, the goal isn't to fail, so why am I failing on purpose, as much as possible? Because failure is the best teacher. If I knew a few things, and I kept creating things based on my knowledge, well yeah it's cool and all that I can create those, it's not making me learn anything. But when I fail, I actually have to do research and question what's the solution.

I probably don't do the best type of research to fix my problems, but the way I look for solutions whenever I encounter something I can't solve, I ask AI how to do it. Because, while I can just google it, I can't talk to these websites. But with AI, it already has so much data in it, and I can ask it about a direct issue instead of generalizing it, and if I don't understand, I can simply just ask for easier ways of explanation. A lot of people use AI to do things for them, but that's not what I'm preaching here. What I'm saying is, AI is very helpful if you use it properly, and in my books, using it properly means to use it to teach yourself. Because if we all rely on something/someone to do something for us, who's going to help omce that thing/person goes away? Exactly, no one. Anyhow, enough giving a pit talk and let's do more technical stuff...

## Real examples | Problem Solving
When I was creating a simple addition/subtraction calculator app, I encountered my first issue; useStates. I didn't know what they were, I didn't know why they were used, but I did know how to use them due to googling it. The problem is that with me, I can't really understand someting unless I know how it works, and so what I did was I simply just asked AI. I asked it to create a code that would do the calculator app, and then I asked it about the things I didn't know. Example:
"What are useStates? What does it do and why did you use it here?"
```js
const [num1, setNum1] = React.useState(0);
```
And then after I'd get my answer, if I don't understand, I change up my prompt and restate it. I also really like asking it for alternatives or asking for an example of something in javascript that represents it. But maybe you don't know javascript, or sometimes I don't know the thing it gives, so another really good prompt I like to ask is "Give me something basic to create that relies on this topic to see whether or not I understand" and then I attempt to do exactly that on my own, and if I fail, I just start over by asking it to fix it, and then asking how does the fix work, etc.
