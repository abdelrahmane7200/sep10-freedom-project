# Entry 2 | Software & Hardware
##### 11/4/24  
## Context  
I've decided on a [topic](entery01.md) to create my website on a few weeks ago. And recently I've been researching technologies in that topic (Chemistry). I've researched both software (Apps, websites, etc) and hardware (Physical technologies, ex; computer). I've searched and picked the ones I found most interesting, while still being very useful and important in the chemical field.
### Software  
I picked 5 different softwares that related to chemistry, here's a list of my top three most favorited ones, and my reasoning behind it.  
1. [ChemDraw](https://revvitysignals.com/products/research/chemdraw)  
ChemDraw is an app that is used for drawing chemical structures. It's very useful as it turns the chemical drawings into IUPAC nomenclature, which is a method of naming chemical structures according to the [IUPAC](https://iupac.org/). Since the app supports [reaction mechanic annotations](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/ap-chemistry-beta/x2eef969c74e0d802:kinetics/x2eef969c74e0d802:reaction-mechanisms/a/reaction-mechanisms) (The sequence of steps that makes a chemical reaction occur), it's helpful in the understanding of chemical reactions. And for the last bit of information I found about the app, is that it connects with other chemical databases, making it easy for referencing to them.
2. [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/)  
It is a 3D molecule building app. Unlike other apps that are similar, this one allows for real time molecular editing and supports [quantim mechanical calculations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/physics-and-astronomy/quantum-mechanical-calculations#:~:text=Quantum%20mechanical%20calculations%20refer%20to,the%20principles%20of%20quantum%20mechanics.). Since this app is open source, this means it is even customizable with plugins, making it do things no other app could, which makes it super dynamic.
3. [Gaussian](https://gaussian.com/gaussian16/)  
This app is made for computation chemistry modeling, but it can do so much more than that. Gaussian can preform [DFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory) (desnity functional theory) calculations. This makes the app helpful for chemistry, but also for physics as well, but that's not my topic so I didn't dig into it that much. This app makes data that's very useful accessible (continue from vibrational.. in notes)
### Hardware
Similarily to software, I picked 5 different hardware devices used in the chemistry field, and I'll give a list of my top three favorites.
1. [Distillation Apparatus](https://www.excedr.com/blog/what-type-of-equipment-is-used-in-chemistry-research)
It purifies liquids using distillation. This is a process of the liquid being hetaed up, then being condensed again. It's very helpful because it can do a lot of different things on its own. Firstly, the [whole distallition process on its own](https://www.britannica.com/summary/distillation). Next, can be used to isolate components based on their boiling points, which leads to being used in essential oils & alcohol. And it's also used to preserve food by making distilled vinegar, which is a fermented product.
2. [Analytical Balance](https://www.britannica.com/technology/analytical-balance)
A very accurate mass measurement tool, often to 0.0001 grams. Its accuracy makes it useful for precise weighing of small quantities in chemical reactions, making it essential for preparing standard solutions and conducting quantitative analyses. Analytical balances also include advanced feuatures, ones like draft sheilds, that [minimize environmental](https://www.fishersci.com/us/en/home.html) factors during chemical reactions.
3. [NMR Tubes](https://www.excedr.com/blog/what-type-of-equipment-is-used-in-chemistry-research)
NMR tubes use a technique for determining the structure of organic compounds and other materials. They're good in [identifying molecular structures, dynamics, and interactions,](https://www.britannica.com/science/nuclear-magnetic-resonance) which with achieving consistent and [reproducible](https://www.google.com/search?q=reproducible+definition&rlz=1CAOFBT_enUS1093&oq=reproducible+defi&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgBEAAYgAQyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQABiABDIHCAIQABiABDIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMgoICBAAGA8YFhgeMgoICRAAGA8YFhge0gEINzEyMmowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&safe=active&ssui=on) results across different experiments. It's also very convenient, since it's easy to handle and transfer, making the risk of contamination very low.

### Skills I learned during this  
* How to find interesting information, and relate technological inventions to certain topics.
I found things that wasn't technological, or that couldn't relate to chemistry, and that's fine, those are obvious to spot. But what wasn't obvious to pick, was something really *interesting*. When I want to expand someone's knowledge on a topic like chemistry for example, I'm not going to teach them about a telescope, or a microscope, because those are very known. So when I search, I think of what is really *intersting*, what excites me when I read it, what makes me want to learn more about, and that's what I end up mentioned and noting down.
* How to use reliable sources
I learned this because when I was looking at random websites, I'd see these magical, too good to be true inventions. Let me give you an example, on a website I found a hardware invention that was used to 'see atoms', and this really surprised me, be cause how did I not know about this? How did my chemistry teacher not know about this, right? Well, only one search of that hardware name later would the answer be revealed, because it's not real. If you checck my list, you'd see that I slowly started to use britannica more, which is a very info-full, and reliable website. But don't worry, the other research I mentioned was still reliable, just not as much as britannica.
